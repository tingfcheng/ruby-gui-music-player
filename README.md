# Ruby-gui-music-player-practice
This is my first ruby gosu project, so the code is not good :flushed:

## Description
There are 4 albums and every album has 15 tracks\
Music player is reading data from a text file which is **album.txt**
> P.S Currently all the tracks are the same in all albums. \
You can change to different tracks audio by changing audio data in the `album.txt`

## How to run the music player
> You should install ruby and gosu into your computer first.
1. Open your Terminal
2. `cd <music player folder>`
3. `ruby gui_music_player.rb`


## Reference
